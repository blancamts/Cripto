The wind whispered softly through the tall trees of Eldenwood as the last rays of sunlight slipped below the horizon. The forest, ancient and vast, seemed alive with secrets only the night could awaken. Clara stood by the riverbank, her reflection trembling on the water’s surface. She had returned to the village after years of traveling, drawn back by dreams she could not explain. Each night, she had seen the same vision — a silver key resting beneath a fallen oak, and a whisper that called her name as though the forest itself remembered her.The villagers had changed, though their faces carried the same gentle kindness she had always known. The baker still sang in the mornings, the blacksmith still whistled as he worked, and the children still chased one another through the cobblestone streets. Yet beneath the laughter and familiar scents of home, Clara sensed something different — as if a shadow lingered unseen, just beyond the edges of the light. It was in the way people lowered their voices at night, or the way the dogs refused to wander near the old well in the square.That evening, she walked deeper into the woods, following the same narrow path she had taken as a child. The air grew colder, the light dimmer, until the only sound was the steady rhythm of her footsteps and the whisper of leaves underfoot. Then she saw it — the oak from her dreams, massive and half-decayed, its roots spreading like veins across the forest floor. Beneath it, half-buried in moss, glinted the edge of a small silver key. She knelt and brushed the dirt away, her breath catching as the key came free. As her fingers closed around it, a sudden gust swept through the forest, and for an instant she heard the same whisper from her dreams, clearer than ever before. It spoke her name, not with menace, but with longing, like a memory calling her home. The trees around her shivered, and somewhere in the distance an owl called. The forest seemed to hold its breath.When she returned to the village, the streets were silent. Lamps flickered in windows, and a light mist curled around the rooftops. Clara felt the weight of the key in her pocket — heavier now, as though it carried more than silver. She knew that something waited for her, somewhere beyond the ordinary. Perhaps it was a door, or a promise, or something even older. Whatever it was, she no longer felt afraid. For the first time in years, she felt exactly where she was meant to be — standing on the edge of mystery, ready to unlock whatever the night had kept hidden for so long.
